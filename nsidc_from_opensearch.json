This data set is comprised of Arctic sea ice concentration climatology derived from the NIC weekly or biweekly operational ice-chart time series. The charts used in the climatology are from 1972 through 2007; and the monthly climatology products are median, maximum, minimum, first quartile, and third quartile concentrations, as well as frequency of occurrence of ice at any concentration for the entire period of record as well as for 10-year and 5-year periods. These climatologies and the charts from which they are derived are provided in the 25-km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) binary (.bin) format. The climatologies are also available in ArcGIS geodatabases (.mdb), and GIF format browse files (.gif) are also provided.\n\nNIC charts are produced through the analyses of available in situ, remote sensing, and model data sources. They are generated primarily for mission planning and safety of navigation. NIC charts generally show more ice than do passive microwave derived sea ice concentrations, particularly in the summer when passive microwave algorithms tend to underestimate ice concentration.

Precipitation data are monthly sums bias corrected for gauge type and for wetting, but not for wind. The correction factors, K1 for gauge type, K2 for wind, and K3 for wetting, are included as separate files. Temperature data are monthly means, for example, the mean of daily temperatures for that month, where daily temperature is defined as the average of all observations for each calendar day. For many stations, average maximum and average minimum temperature are supplied as well. These are derived from daily maximum and minimum temperatures. The station metadata for this data set are station histories, population, vegetation, and topography. Data were subjected to rigorous quality control and homogenieity assessment procedures, consistent with those used for the GHCN.\n\nThere are records from 298 stations. The period of record covered by each station is variable, and in the period from 1985 to 1995, there was a sharp reduction in the number of operating stations. The earliest record is from 1879. Records are updated through 2003 where data are available. Most stations have almost 100 years of observations.

Arctic charts from 1933 through 2006 are collected in this data set. Chart frequency and spatial coverage varies, but charts were compiled every 10 days during the navigation season, and monthly for the rest of the year, over most of the series. There is a gap with no charts from 1993 through 1996. Chart coverage focuses on the Northern Sea Route, although later charts extend into the central Arctic.  The charts were compiled from a variety of data sources, with heavy reliance on regular reconnaissance flights for most of the series until 1992.\n\nEarly paper charts were digitized, and the entire series, including later charts that were produced entirely digitally, were converted to Sea Ice Grid (SIGRID) format at AARI. AARI provided code to read the SIGRID data and convert it to a format close to Equal Area Scalable (EASE)-Grid. NSIDC completed the conversion to EASE-Grid. The EASE-Grid is in a Lambert equal-area projection with 12.5 km cell size. Total ice concentration, as well as partial concentrations for multiyear, first-year, new/young ice (ice younger than first-year ice), and fast ice, are given in EASE-Grid (binary), SIGRID (ASCII), and browse (PNG) files. Data are available via FTP.

The SIZONet web interface provides access to a database of local observations spatially referenced around Alaskan villages. The database brings together two distinct knowledge systems of western science and local and traditional knowledge. As an archive and instruction tool, the interface offers collaborating opportunities for hunters and their communities. Since it is designed to change in response to the evolving nature of the observations, the database provides a framework for researchers to track and compare specific climatic, environmental and ecological features, and events across geographic locations and over time.\n\nThe goal of this project is to preserve and pass on local and traditional knowledge of sea ice and its use knowledge. In documenting local sea ice change, records may offer insight into how that change affects community and cultural activity. Arctic coastal communities have long recognized that sea ice conditions are not what they once were: the ocean is freezing later in the fall and ice is melting earlier in the spring, shore-fast ice is less stable, there is far less thick multiyear ice, and environmental conditions overall are less predictable. \n\nTo view the observations in the database, visitors must agree to the Use Agreement and enter as a Guest.

Scale 1 to 2,500,000. The digital map was assembled and edited in ARC/INFO. The source map projection is polyconic. It is based on the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid with a central meridian of 150 W longitude. The data were geo-referenced from digitizer coordinates to the polyconic projection and then projected into an Albers Equal Area projection.

SSM/I images are available for 1995 through 2008, and AMSR-E images are available for 2002 through 2010. All available measurements for a single day are averaged into twice-daily gridded files for three different equal-area spatial coverages: Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, and full global. The spatial resolution is 12.5 km for SSM/I channels 19 and 22 GHz, 7.5 km for 37 GHz, and 2.5 km for the 85 GHz channel. For AMSR-E, the resolution is 12.5 km for the 6, 10, 18, and 23 GHz channels; 7.5 km for the 36 GHz channel; and 2.5 km for the 89 GHz channel. Software for reading the SIR-formatted SSM/I and AMSR-E data is also available. As scatterometer and radiometer data complement each other, these enhanced-resolution radiometer data, together with SIR format scatterometer data available from BYU, will facilitate polar research that combines information from both radiometers and scatterometers.

The TSP project goals included the acquisition of standardized temperature measurements (snapshots) from all permafrost regions on Earth, preparation of a global data set, and development of maps of contemporary permafrost temperatures. As a result of the project, networks of boreholes, equipped for long-term permafrost temperature observations, were established and consist of approximately 860 boreholes in both hemispheres with more than 25 participating countries. Approximately 350 of the boreholes were drilled and instrumented during the IPY period under various nationally funded projects. Comparison of the current Mean Annual Ground Temperature (MAGT) and historical data allows participating countries and other users to assess the thermal state of permafrost dynamics over the last several decades. The TSP project also included active layer measurements, many of which are observed annually under the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) project. Future plans are for these networks to become part of an international network of permafrost observatories with data available for monitoring and multidisciplinary research in both polar and non-polar permafrost regions.\n\nThis data set consists of an inventory of these boreholes in two Excel spreadsheets &mdash; one by country (TSP_Borehole_inventory_countries.xls) and one as a composite (TSP_borehole_inventory_composite.xls) for ease in searching. The spreadsheets include the geographic coordinates of the boreholes, elevation, depth of borehole (BH), year drilled, the MAGT, permafrost (PF) thickness, country, responsible person, affiliation, and sponsors. A summary of the number and type of boreholes by country is provided in a PDF document (N_and_S_hemisphere_borehole_summary.pdf), and a high-resolution JPEG image of the borehole locations (TSP_BoreHoles_location_map_highres.jpg) is also included. The inventory lists boreholes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres with 790 of the boreholes located in the Northern Hemisphere. The inventory primarily concentrates on measurements from new and existing boreholes from 2007 to 2009. For historical purposes, some boreholes active since the 1980s are included. Boreholes are classified as four different types: surface (SU) &lt;10 m, shallow (SH) 10-25 m, intermediate (IB) 25-125 m, and deep (DB) &gt;125 m according to the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) classification. For Antarctica, the surface boreholes are split into two subclasses: &lt;SU (&lt;2 m) and SU (2-10 m). The TSP is a field component of the <a href=\"http://www.gtnp.org\">Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost<\/a> (www.gtnp.org).\n\nData from over 500 of these boreholes are presented and discussed in a series of papers in the special IPY - TSP issue of <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.v21:2/issuetoc\">Permafrost and Periglacial Processes<\/a> (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.v21:2/issuetoc) that include five regional papers and one synthesis paper.

Each year since then, Alaska residents have guessed at the timing of the river breakup. A tripod, connected to an on-shore clock with a string, is planted in two feet of river ice during river freeze-up in October or November. The following spring, the clock automatically stops when the tripod moves as the ice breaks up. The time on the clock is used as the river ice breakup time.\n\nMany factors influence the river ice breakup, such as air temperature, ice thickness, snow cover, wind, water temperature, and depth of water below the ice.

Estimates of sea ice extent were produced from daily-averaged QuikSCAT sigma-0 measurements and extend from 19 July 1999 to 31 December 2009.\n\nQuikSCAT obtains 12 individual radar normalized backscatter (sigma-0) measurements, called slices, for each footprint as it scans over a 1800 km wide swath. Slices are typically 4 to 6 km long by 20 km wide. The summed measurements of the slices are called egg measurements. The effective resolution and shape of each egg measurement is approximately 20 by 30 km, depending on the antenna beam and instrument mode. This data set contains both slice and egg images for each day.\n\nThe Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (MERS) group at Brigham Young University (BYU) developed a SIR-with-filtering (SIRF) algorithm that combines forward- and aft-looking sigma-0 measurements to produce enhanced-resolution backscatter images over various azimuth angles. The polarization ratio, incidence angle dependence, and the sigma-0 estimate error standard deviation were used to discriminate between sea ice and ocean.

Both versions exist for each of the five stations for a total of 10 files. The complete versions of the files reside in the directory called <em>complete<\/em> and have the word <em>full<\/em> in their filename.

The subsetted versions of the files reside in the <em>subset<\/em> directory and have <em>subset<\/em> in their filename. These files contain data from the 0.8 m and 3.2 m depths only.

For data-sparse areas such as China, Greenland, the Arctic and  Antarctica, special Rand methodologies were used: empirical evaluation of total precipitation, weather source regions, latitude, temperature, terrain and annual   snow depth data. Monthly ice-pack limits from U.S. Navy Oceanographic Office were used to extend the zero snow accumulation line over the oceans. These mean monthly data can be used strictly as a climatological summary or for systematic  comparison with simulations from any general circulation model (GCM), or for  initiating GCM calculations.

The landfast ice extent data extend from 1996 through 2004 and are based on RADARSAT-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The data are available in a number of formats including ArcGIS geodatabases (.mdb), shapefiles (.shp), ArcGIS grids (.adf), ArcGIS grids in ArcInfo interchange format (.e00), and GeoTIFFs (.tif). Statistics are also provided in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (.xls) and metadata in several formats including XML (.xml), SGML (.sgml), HTML (.html), and ASCII text (.txt). Quick-view browse images in JPEG (.jpg) format are provided for the shapefiles, grids, and GeoTIFFs.

Brown (2000) describes the method, which is considered to be more robust than SCE reconstruction based on statistical methods (see Brown, 1997; Frei et al., 1999).\n\nIn addition, the data set contains time series of annual variation in areally-averaged monthly snow depth and (SWE) for the North American grid domain used to derive the snow cover index.

NASA\ndeveloped slope correction routines for the higher slopes over the ice\nsheets, relative to ocean surfaces. The data are height profile Level\n3 data and gridded height Level 4 data provided by the Oceans and Ice\nbranch of the Laboratory for Hydrospheric Physics of Goddard Space\nFlight Center. Elevations from the full data rate (i.e., one\nmeasurement every 662.5 m) are provided in georeferenced databases.\nThese elevations are relative to the WGS-84 ellipsoid. Gridded\nelevations at 10-kilometer and 20-kilometer spacing are provided in\nthe gridded data sets created from the GEOSAT and Seasat data,\nrespectively. Software to extract and browse subsets of these data is\nincluded. The IAS software also allows the user to view\ncontours created from the gridded data and groundtracks of the\nfull-rate data.\n"],"box":["60.0 -60.0 72.0 -20.0"],"date":["1978-06-01/1986-09-30"],"link":[],"link.1":[],"link.2":[],"link.3":[],"datasetId":["NSIDC-0053"],"author":{"name":["H.

In most cases, holes were logged by lowering a probe containing a regions of Northern Canada. In most cases, holes were logged by lowering a probe containing a thermistor incrementally down the well, in other cases multi-thermistor cables were left in the holes and periodic measurements taken. In the 1990's, a few holes were logged by a automatic quasi- continuous logging system. Most holes were logged annually for 5-10 years after drilling completion, and measured temperatures show the disturbance due to drilling and the gradual recovery to near-undisturbed conditions. Some holes in the collection are of depth less than 125 m. Permafrost thicknesses are estimated at each well or hole from the depth of the 0 degree Celsius isotherm. This data collection provides the highest quality of permafrost temperature and permafrost thickness information available for Northern Canada. Other data are the large number of downhole temperature and permafrost thickness estimates taken during commercial well logging of petroleum exploration wells, and are by nature of lesser quality. These data are not included in this data set, but references to compilations of this data are provided. A short text (2000 words), tables of site locations and permafrost thicknesses with small-scale maps, and an extensive bibliography accompany the data collection. The file structure and contents of each file are well described.

In January 1996, the EWG Arctic\nClimatology Group took on the task of compiling digital data on arctic regions to expand scientific understanding of the Arctic. This work resulted in a set of three atlases on CD-ROM for arctic oceanography,\nsea ice, and meteorology.\n\nThe Arctic Meteorology and Climate Atlas was developed by specialists from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI), St. Petersburg, Russia, the University of Washington, Seattle, and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, University of Colorado, Boulder. The Atlas contains three main sections: a history section, a 'Primer,' and a data section.

Although some of the early measurements were obtained using thermistor strings frozen into permafrost, the vast majority of the measurements were made in fluid-filled holes using a custom temperature sensor. A typical sensor used in Alaska prior to 1989 consisted of a series-parallel network of 20 thermistors; see Sass et al. [1971] for a more detailed description. During a logging experiment, the resistance of the thermistor network was determined using a Wheatstone bridge prior to 1967. After that time, a 4-wire resistance measurement was made using a commercial 5.5-digit multimeter (DMM). Before 1984, boreholes were logged in the 'incremental' or 'stop-and-go' modes; the vertical spacing of the measurements was typically 3-15 m. Beginning in 1984, the depth/resistance measurements were automatically stored on magnetic tape, allowing boreholes to be logged in the 'continuous' mode; the typical data spacing for the continuous temperature logs was 0.3 m (1 ft). Many of the Alaskan boreholes were re-logged several times to quantify the thermal disturbance caused by drilling the holes (see Lachenbruch and Brewer [1959]). A review of current temperature measuring techniques used by the USGS in the polar regions is given by Clow et al. [1996].

Five km Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of ice-surface and bedrock topography (Bamber et al. 2001) were used to estimate the hydraulic potentiometric surface for Greenland, which accounts for the effects of ice overburden pressure, such as hydrostatic pressure, surface topography, and underlying bedrock topography (Paterson 1994). Using the 5 km potentiometric grid, a modeled basin network for Greenland's ice sheet was created using the hydrological tools within ESRI ArcGIS (ArcInfo 9.2).

First, it sought to characterize the dynamic environment and ice stratigraphy of Siple Dome and its surroundings, with the specific mission of assessing Siple Dome as a potential deep core site; and second, to determine whether the configuration of ice stream flow in the region has changed over time. Both goals are relevant to understanding the dynamics of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), its history, and potential future behavior.\n\nThis project was a collaboration between Saint Olaf College, the University of Washington, and the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. It included studies of satellite imagery and acquisition and analysis of field data from GPS, firn cores and snow pits, and ground-based ice-penetrating radar.\n\nData in this collection were obtained during two Antarctic field seasons in 1994–95 and 1996–97.

In January 1996, the EWG Arctic Climatology Group took on the task of compiling digital data on arctic regions to expand scientific understanding of the Arctic. This work resulted in a set of three atlases on arctic oceanography, sea ice, and meteorology. These atlases are distributed via FTP.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group Joint U.S.-Russian Atlas of the Arctic Ocean was developed by specialists from the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan with Russian and U.S. partners. The Atlas consist of separate volumes for winter and summer, with the following file names G01961a and G01961b respectively. More than 1.3 million individual temperature and salinity observations collected from Russian and western drifting stations, ice breakers, and airborne expeditions were used to develop the products contained in the winter volume. \n\nThe primary products of the Atlas are gridded mean fields for decadal periods (1950s,1960s, 1970s, 1980s) of temperature, salinity, density and dynamic height, Atlantic water layer depth, and temperature and salinity profiles and transects. The original individual observations that were used to derive these fields are not provided with the Atlas and are not available. \n\nNote that the Polar Science Center Hydrographic Climatology (PHC) ocean database (version 3.0) is available from the Polar Science Center, Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington.

These data are comprised of surface-climate measurements, including solar time, wind speed, wind direction, dry-bulb, wet-bulb, and vapor pressure in 24 sites focused at the three Northern Canadian locations. The sites were chosen to include a variety of terrains in the study: sedge fen wetland, willow-birch wetland, lichen-heath, bedrock boulders/heath, spruce- tamarack forest, tundra lake, creek, various (e.g. a basin: sedge, willow, lichen-heath, forest, etc.), sparse vegetation (short grass/sedge, heath spp.), and coastal marsh (tall grass, sandy soils). \n\nThe measurements were taken in increments ranging from seasonally to every 15 minutes. In all, 177 different variables were measured and recorded. The data are valuable due to their unique and consistent nature.\n\nClimoBase was created to provide a central repository for Dr. Wayne Rouse's raw field data. Dr. Rouse is now Professor Emeritus at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. Dr. Rouse was considered by the Canadian Association of Geographers (CAG) to have \"pioneered field research on the evaporation of high latitude sites, including woodlands, tundra, wetland and lake surfaces\" (1998). He received the 1998 CAG Award for Scholarly Distinction in Geography. In 2001, Dr. Roger Barry, the Director of NSIDC at the time, received a copy of ClimoBase for NSIDC.

The data include recent pedons from analyses for soil characterization and research within the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Less-than-complete characterization data are available for many pedons because only selected measurements were planned or because the planned measurements are not yet complete. This database is dynamic-- data for additional pedons are added as they are sampled and analyzed, other information is updated as pedons are classified, suspect measurements are rerun and replaced, and errors are found and corrected. The data on the NSSC-SSL CD-ROM represent a 'snapshot' of the database. The database includes pedons that represent the central concept of a soil series, pedons that represent the central concept of a map unit but not of a series, and pedons sampled to bracket a range of properties within a series or landscape. Thus, attribute data for some data elements may be incomplete or missing for certain portions of the United States. In instances where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area from the analysis. For research purposes, all data are retained in the database.

Land surface emissivity estimates for this data set were collected at the following vertically and horizontally polarized (V-pol and H-pol) frequencies: 6.9, 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz. Ancillary data used in the analysis, such as surface skin temperature and cloud mask, were obtained from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). Atmospheric properties were obtained from TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) observations to determine the small upwelling and downwelling atmospheric emissions as well as the atmospheric transmission. The data set is in monthly format that is extracted from instantaneous emissivity estimates. Data are stored in HDF4 files and are available via FTP."],"box":["-90.0 -180.0 90.0 180.0"],"date":["2002-07-01/2008-06-30"],"link":[],"link.1":[],"link.2":[],"link.3":[],"datasetId":["NSIDC-0543"],"author":{"name":["Hamidreza  Norouzi"]},"author.1":{"name":["Marouane  Temimi"]},"author.2":{"name":["William B.

The mosaic image shows both the location of the ice edge and the distribution of melt-related 'scatterers' on the surface. These scatterers include ice lenses and complex layered structure in the percolation zone and bare ice of the ablation zone.  Other melt-related features that can be seen include lake and surface meltwater stream channels at lower elevations, as well as ice-marginal lakes.\n\nThis characterization of the ice sheet provides a reference against which future change can be measured. Changing conditions resulting from climatic variation should show up as changes in the ice margin and shifts in the hydrologic zones. It is hoped that the standard reference provided by this data set can facilitate activities aimed at change detection and promote other work aimed at understanding the processes operating on the ice sheet.\n\nThe image data are derived from SAR image swaths acquired by the ERS-1 satellite during August of 1992. The mosaic was assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Its component images are a copyrighted product of the European Space Agency. The mosaic, a value-added derived product, is available to individuals and non-profit organizations for research oriented purposes only. The Danish geodetic and cadastral agency Kort-og Matrikelstyrelsen (KMS) compiled the elevation data provided with the product from a number of sources, including field surveys, aerial photographs, and the ERS-1 radar altimeter. The elevation data are also provided only to individuals and non-profit organizations for research oriented purposes. Included with the data is NSIDC's limb (large image map browser) software, which was developed in-house and allows UNIX users to easily select and view portions of the mosaic image with elevation contours derived from the elevation data overlain. Limb is provided as 'freeware' for general use.

There are 460 observed hydrologic outlets that include proglacial streams and rivers emerging from the ice sheet (length scale >1 km), proglacial lakes touching the ice edge or clearly connected to it via streams or rivers (length scale >3 km), and sediment-rich plumes exiting tidewater glaciers into fjords. Also, there are 431 potential hydrologic outlets that include point locations with release of meltwater from fjords without obvious sediment discharge, as well as locations where the ice sheet directly connects to the ocean that cannot be proven to release meltwater.\n\nMeltwater features along the entire edge of the ice sheet were mapped via photo interpretation of GoogleEarth and Landsat ETM+ 15 m panchromatic data. The exact acquisition dates of the imagery are not available; however, owing to the light and relatively snow-free conditions seen in the GoogleEarth and Landsat images, it is presumed that they were taken during the summer season. Neither Landsat or GoogleEarth images were available for a section of ice sheet within the northern Tunu region; therefore, that region was excluded from the study. This excluded area represents approximately 0.9 percent of the ice sheet perimeter. Data are available via FTP, and can be read in any GIS software.

In this interactive, multi-media CD-ROM, Inuit from \ntwo communties, Baker Lake (Qamani'tuaq) and Clyde River (Kangiktugaapik) in Nunavut, Canada, share \ntheir observations and perspectives on recent environmental changes. The CD-ROM is a pilot project \nthat uses media technology as an alternative way (as opposed to written reports) to document and communicate Inuit observations and knowledge. Maps, text, photos, video and music are integrated to \nhelp illustrate the changes Inuit have observed in their environment and the impacts on their \nlivelihoods. The integrated components allow the user to search by topic or person; view interview clips \nin Inuktitut with English interpretations; view and print maps about environmental changes drawn by \nparticipants; view short videos with scenes from the communities; view summaries and photos of \nenvironmental changes and their impacts to the landscape and community life. Topics include sea ice, \nsnow, wind, weather variability, changes in seasons, changes in activities, animals, and more.\n\n\nPlease Note: This CD-ROM is Copyright Shari Fox (Gearheard), 2003 (the author).

{"id":["GGD282"],"datasetVersion":["1"],"title":["Rock glaciers, Western Andes, Chile"],"updated":["2012-08-24"],"temporal_duration":[],"spatial_area":["11.0"],"summary":["The research area is located along a transect from 18 deg S to 29 deg S in the Chilean Altiplano, the western part of the high intramontane plateau in the Central Andes. This region is located in an extremely arid zone between the tropical and westerly circulation belt. The so-called 'Andean Dry Diagonal' crosses the research area from NW to SE. \n\nOver 120 rock glaciers have been mapped from chosen test sites using aerial photographs. Several rock glaciers were visited in the field to compare the results. From the collected data (height above sea level, exposition, activity, latitude) we tried to conclude (paleo-)climatic implications. The distribution was compared with summer and winter precipitation patterns of the research area. The highest number of observed rock glaciers appears in the north and very south of the transect--18 and 29 deg S. Between 23 and 27 deg S there is a sharp decline in the number of rock glaciers. It coincides with the present-day position of the 'Dry Diagonal' in the Western Andes. Most of the mountains in this section have no rock glaciers, although there is sufficient debris supply available. Focusing on activity, altitude, and latitude of the observed rock glaciers north of 24 deg S, respectively, south of 27 deg S there is a domination of active and inactive rock glaciers in\ncomparison to relict rock glaciers.\n\nOn the other hand, there are no active rock glaciers between 24 and 27 deg S. In this part, relict rock glaciers can lie 800 m higher than the estimated annual 0-degree C isotherm. If we compare rock glacier activity and number with the precipitation pattern of the area we note that the biggest number of active rock glaciers lie in the region with highest precipitation rates. In the driest part of the test area where the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Western Andes there are no active rock glaciers. They can be found in areas with estimated annual precipitation rates of 200 mm and more. Most of the observed rock glaciers lie in ice free cirques. These were probably built up after, or at, the time of a general ice decay. For the northern part between 18 and 24 deg S, we suggest glacier advances during the so-called Tauca-phase at 12,000-8,000 yr BP. The majority of the rock glaciers in this area can only have formed after 8,000 yr BP. In the southern part of the research area at 29 deeg S, we dated a late Holocene glacier advance at 2,600 yr BP, and thus rock glaciers must have formed at the time of the general ice decay after 2,600 yr BP.\n\nThe altitude of active rock glaciers in the Chilean Andes between 18 and 29 deg S corresponds to the trend of the annual degree C isotherm, with a sharp interruption in the driest zone between 24 and 27 deg S. In this part with less than 100 mm precipitation/yr, the annual 0-degree  C isotherm has no control on rock glacier activity -- the observed relict and inactive rock glaciers lie distinctly higher. The driest zone of the research area corresponds with the area with a striking reduction of number of rock glaciers and also coincides with the zone where no active rock glaciers could be found. We conclude that the so-called 'Andean Dry Diagonal' cannot have changed significantly it's position since the time when the rock glaciers were formed, probably in the middle and late Holocene. But we assume an intensification of precipitation to form rock glaciers in the driest part of the research area.

Station Alpha was the first long-term scientific base on arctic pack ice operated by a Western country. At the time of its establishment, Russia had already operated six drifting ice camps of this kind. However, due to the strategic importance and sensitivity of the Arctic Basin, little information from these early stations had reached the West. The documentary was filmed and produced by Frans van der Hoeven (Senior Scientist at Station Alpha) and Norbert Untersteiner (Scientific Leader of Station Alpha).

To this effect two data logger stations were established in the summit region of the Waaihoek mountains. Two sites were established at Waaihoek Peak and Mount Superior, respectively.\n\nWaaihoek Peak - The Waaihoek Peak monitoring site is positioned on the southeast extension of a small summit plateau at 1900m elevation where it changes into a southeast trending ridge flanked by two small valleys. The station stands on a 4 to 5 degree slope with an aspect of 140 degrees and is underlain by steeply dipping quartzitic sandstone of the Peninsula Formation. A shallow sandy soil here reaches a thickness of 0.35m and supports a sparse vegetation cover of Restio (Cape reeds) species up to 0.2m high with a total cover of around 30%. Initially both daily and hourly records were kept which necessitated frequent visits to replace the data storage tapes. As from 29-11-1992 only daily records were kept, including maximum and minimum temperature and 24 hour precipitation totals. Average daily soil moisture levels were recorded only as the range between daily maximum and minium values proved to be minimal.\n\nMount Superior - Field observations established the presence of active soil frost features near Mount Superior during December 1991. A second data logger site was consequently established by 1-5-1993 to provide microclimatic data from a site with a different substrate and currently active soil-frost processes. The Mount Superior station is positioned 5km SSE of the Waaihoek Peak site on a flat summit plateau of Cedarberg shale at 1860m elevation. The surface cover is comprised of fractured bedrock and bare shallow soil with tussocks of Restio spp. up to 0.5m high. Daily maximum and minimum temperature were recorded for each sensor as well as daily average relative soil moisture levels and daily precipitation totals.\n\nThese data are presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM, June 1998."],"box":["-33.533 19.25 -33.417 19.5"],"date":["1990-02-01/"],"link":[],"link.1":[],"link.2":[],"link.3":[],"datasetId":["GGD482"],"author":{"name":["Jan Boelhouwers"]},"dataCenter":["National Snow and Ice Data Center"],"supportingProgram":["FGDC"],"Parameters":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Cryosphere"],"Term":["Snow/Ice"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Freeze/Thaw"]},"Parameters.1":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Terrestrial Hydrosphere"],"Term":["Snow/Ice"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Freeze/Thaw"]},"Parameters.2":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Cryosphere"],"Term":["Frozen Ground"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Seasonally Frozen Ground"]},"Parameters.3":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Land Surface"],"Term":["Frozen Ground"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Seasonally Frozen Ground"]},"Parameters.4":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Agriculture"],"Term":["Soils"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Soil Moisture/Water Content"]},"Parameters.5":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Land Surface"],"Term":["Soils"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Soil Moisture/Water Content"]},"Parameters.6":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Agriculture"],"Term":["Soils"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Soil Structure"]},"Parameters.7":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Land Surface"],"Term":["Soils"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Soil Structure"]},"Parameters.8":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Agriculture"],"Term":["Soils"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Soil Temperature"]},"Parameters.9":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Cryosphere"],"Term":["Frozen Ground"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Soil Temperature"]},"Parameters.10":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Land Surface"],"Term":["Frozen Ground"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Soil Temperature"]},"Parameters.11":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Land Surface"],"Term":["Soils"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Soil Temperature"]},"Keyword":["Active Layer"],"Keyword.1":["Diurnal Freeze/thaw"],"Keyword.2":["Meteorology"],"Keyword.3":["Monitoring"],"Keyword.4":["Soil Properties"],"Keyword.5":["Soil Temperature"],"Distribution":{"Distribution_Format":["ASCII Text"]}}

Observations are carried out on more than 40 boreholes, at altitudes between 3300-4200 m. The depths of the boreholes vary from 30 to 600 m. The boreholes are located in both loose (moraines) sediments and bedrock. Several boreholes are situated in the territory of the 'Kumtor' goldmine. The geocryological conditions of goldmine 'Kumtor' and nearby territory have been discussed in scientific reports 1988, 1989 and articles (see references). Two boreholes were drilled in body of glacier 'Davydov' and located in the central and lateral parts of the glacier (depth - 30 m). A third borehole passed through the glacier, moraine and bedrock to a depth of 600 m. In the Kumtor and Taragai valleys, permafrost temperature in 14 boreholes from 25 to 50 m depth, between 3300-3750 m ASL were observed. The distance between outermost boreholes is about 40 km.\n\nTemperature measurements in 9 geological prospecting adits [tunnels] (lengthwise 1500-1900 m) located in the four neighboring valleys (altitudes from 3920 to 4010 m) were carried out. At the same sites, but in natural conditions, the thermal conductivity of the bedrock was determined by the cylindrical sounding method. Grain size, soil moisture content, cryogenic structure and depth of seasonal thaw were also obtained from 15 pits located in differing altitudinal levels and exposures. At two further sites, ground temperatures measurements at depths of 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 40 cm were taken every hour during daylight hours every 5 days over a two year period. Air temperature, wind velocity and duration of daylight were measured at the same time as the ground temperature measurements.

The Index Map of Yamal Peninsula (VSEGINGEO-Earth Cryosphere Institute SB RAS; PI -  Prof.E.S.Melnikov) was originally compiled at a scale of 1 to 1,000,000, as 'The Map of Natural Complexes of West Siberia for the Purpose of Geocryological Prediction and Planning of Nature-Protection Measures for the Mass Construction, 1 to 1 mln' (1991) by E.S.Melnikov and N.G.Moskalenko (eds.). It was taken as a base map for nature-protection regionalization. Environmental 'regions', 'sub-regions', 'landscapes' and localities' shown on a landscape map are merged into the nature-protection regions. The map was compiled by interpreting more than 1000 satellite images and aerial photos as well as from analysis of field data from several institutions. Dominating components of the landscape, composition of the surface deposits, geocryological conditions and natural protection of ground water were considered while distinguishing the Nature-Protection Regions within the limits of Environmental Regions (Melnikov, 1988). The map is supplied with relevant databases, containing the following information - number of regions and landscape type; category of resiliency; category of the ground water protection; vegetation type; geological and geocryological structure to the depth of 10-15 m; ice content (of lenses and of macro-inclusions separately); thickness of seasonally frozen and seasonally thawed layers; ground temperature; contemporary exogenic geological (periglacial) processes; and the area affected by these processes.\n\nThe 55 nature-protection regions of Yamal Peninsula generalize information. To approve the ranges of geocryological and cryolithological characteristics, 160 boreholes were retrieved out of the database containing more than 4000 boreholes data obtained in 1977-1990 by Fundamentproekt Design Institute (Moscow, Russia; PI - Dr.sci.M.A.Minkin) at Kharasavey and Bovanenkovo gas fields and along the pipelines Yamal-Ukhta and Yamal-Uzhgorod. The boreholes have reference to geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), as well as to the nature-protection region numbers shown on the Index Map. A total of 21 units are covered by borehole data, 5-8 boreholes in each unit, covering most typical conditions\n\nThe original database consisted of 3 relational tables. The first table includes category of resiliency; locality type description; landscape type description; ground-ice content, water saturation, cryogenic structure, macro-ground-ice content; vegetation types; seasonally frozen and seasonally thawed layer depths; ground temperature at 10 m; exogenic geological\n processes an their paragenesis and combinations; and degree of the surface disturbance. The second relational table contains layer-by-layer description of the lithological section types. The third table for the boreholes includes the description of topography around the borehole; types of geological profiles through the active layer and depths down to the permafrost table; ground temperature at 10-m depth (close to the depth of zero annual amplitude in the area); macro-ice content; and salinity of permafrost.

Investigators derived maps of the ice sheet surface and subglacial topography, which covers the entire catchments of both the Thwaites Glacier and the Pine Islands Glacier, from airborne survey systems mounted on a Twin Otter aircraft. The surveys had sufficient density to identify critical ice dynamic transitions within the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE). \n\nThe ASE is the only major drainage to exhibit significant elevation change over the period of available satellite observations. Modeling of the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) deglaciation pinpointed the Pine Island Glacier and the Thwaites Glacier, which comprise a major portion of the ASE, as the most vulnerable features of the WAIS. Present knowledge of the ice thickness and subglacial boundary conditions in the ASE are insufficient to understand its evolution or its sensitivity to climatic change, and it is not yet determined whether these changes are evidence of ongoing deglaciation or simply a fluctuation that does not threaten the equilibrium of the ice sheet. This research will support the efforts of a community of United States and international researchers to assess the present and predict the future behavior of the ice sheet in the ASE. \n\nThese data are available via FTP."],"box":["-81.7 -134.9 -71.7 -84.5"],"date":["2004-11-01/2005-03-31"],"link":[],"link.1":[],"link.2":[],"link.3":[],"link.4":[],"datasetId":["NSIDC-0292"],"author":{"name":["John W.

The Northern Alps as well as the Southern Alps are predominantly built of limestone and have poor glaciation in spite of high amounts of precipitation (2000-3000 mm/a) due to the fact that they reach elevations of not more than 3000 m. In contrast the Central Alps consist of metamorphic rocks and receive less precipitation, but are glaciated on large areas (highest mountain of Austria: Groglockner, 3797 m). Recent permafrost and rock glaciers are best developed in the Central Alps, where discontinuous mountain permafrost occurs above a mean altitude of 2500 m.\n\nRock glaciers were mapped from aerial photographs (different years, most of them 1980-1990) completely covering the area described above. The inventory comprises 1451 rock glaciers with data on their horizontal and vertical position, activity, and morphometric characteristics of each rock glacier. The distinction between active and inactive rock glaciers within the activity class 'intact' was not possible due to the quality of the photographs. Only 19 % of the rock glaciers were classified as intact, while 81 % are relict ones and in most cases of Late Glacial age (a great part of the investigated is situated below present day lower limit of permafrost).

The data presented here are therefore averaged on a regional scale. Some detailed geomorpholgical maps exist, however, where more detailed information can be extracted. The data listed are therefore not a complete database of Norwegian rock glaciers. Recently detailed studies have been carried out on rockglaciers in the Ny Alesund and the Longyearbyen areas on Svalbard. From these studies, detailed data are available.\n\nOn mainland Norway, there are at least 150 rock glaciers (Sollid and Sorbel 1992) . These may be grouped as follows:\n1. Probably active rock glaciers in high mountain areas in southern and northern Norway. Most of these are situated in the Rondane mountain area of southern Norway.\n2. Relict rock glaciers in low-lying areas near the coast of northern Norway. These rock glaciers have a position marginal to the Weichselian ice sheet and were formed during permafrost conditions before or during deglaciation.\n3. Relict rock glaciers in higher inland areas of northern Norway. These rock glaciers are believed to have formed under permafrost conditions during deglaciation possibly because of rock falls caused by tectonic activity during isostatic uplift. On Svalbard, there are at least 500 rock glaciers (Kristiansen and Sollid 1986). Most of these are situated on the central and western part of Spitsbergen. They are most common in coastal areas, often below the steep escarpment which delimits the inner part of the strandflat. As Svalbard has continuous permafrost, most of these are probably active. Some may however be inactive, as for instance the rock glaciers at Stuphallet near Ny Alesund (Sollid and Sorbel 1992). In those cases, the rock glaciers have moved out of its source area and onto the strandflat. \n\nPartly in cooperation with ETH-Zurich, detailed investigations have been started in the Ny Alesund area, Western Spitsbergen. These investigations have been enlarged also to the Longyearbyen area, central Spitsbergen. Principal methods have been velocity measurements, using theodolite/EDM, GPS and photogrammetry; geophysical methods (DC resistivity soundings, seismic refraction soundings, gravimetry and georadar); and morphometrical analysis using a Digital Elevation Model and a grid-based GIS. Typical velocities are between 5 and 10 cm/year, both for lobate and tongue-shaped rock glaciers.

Knowledge of the permafrost flow field provides important information about the origin, morphology, development, dynamics and internal structure of creeping mountain permafrost. Monitoring permafrost behavior helps detecting climate signals.\n\nAerial photogrammetry was used for determining digital terrain models (DTM) with high resolution. The differences of multitemporal DTMs of a rock glacier provide the vertical changes of the permafrost surface. Horizontal surface displacements were obtained by simultaneously comparing two aerial photographs taken at different times and from different positions (Kaeaeb 1996a,b; Kaeaeb et al.1998). Repeated overridings by the nearby glacier affected the upper part of the Gruben rock glacier, Wallis. Compared to the lower, periglacial part of the rock glacier the higher surface lowering rates of the debris-covered dead ice remains indicate the dead ice being out of equilibrium. Due to different internal structure and different slopes, horizontal surface velocities show different creep directions as well as different creep rates. The rock glacier advances by about 12 cm/a. A 25-year time series of photogrammetrical monitoring (1970-1995) documents the temporal variations of surface kinematics of the rock glacier (Kaeaeb et al. 1998a).  Surface kinematics of Muragl rock glacier (Upper Engadin) over the period from 1981 to 1994 reveal this rock glacier to be a complex system of several individual streams. Changes in elevation show a pattern of zones of surface heave and subsidence in the range of +- 10 cm/a. The rock glacier advances by about 5 cm/a (Kaeaeb 1998). The velocity field 1987-1996 at the surface of Murtel rock glacier, Upper Engadin, points to two dynamically different parts of the creeping permafrost-- (1) high activity and transverse ridges in the inner part and (2) lower activity at the left and right margins. The ridges are advected down stream with a velocity approximately equal to the surface velocity. Stream lines can be interpolated from the surface velocity field. The curvature of the isochrones on Murtel rock glacier is similar to the curvature of the transverse ridges, which suggests slow changes in the flow field (Kaeaeb 1998, Kaeaeb et al. 1998b).

Data also include related firn\ntemperature measurements.\n\nThe objective of this research was to better understand thermal\nfractionation processes affecting records of atmospheric history from\nfirn and ice core gases.  Recent work (e.g., Severinghaus and Brook,\n1999) has exploited trapped air in ice and deep firn as a record of\npast atmospheric composition and climate change. Interpretation of these paleoclimate archives is complicated by artifacts of thermal\ndiffusion, a process in which heavier gases migrate down temperature\ngradients toward colder regions in the firn. Seasonal temperature\nchange at the snow surface creates strong temperature gradients in the\ntop few meters of the firn, which cause isotopic fractionation of firn\ngases.  A specific goal of this research is to identify any long-term\neffects of seasonal temperature fluctuations on firn air isotopic\nanomalies."],"box":["-89.997 -102.0 -89.997 -102.0"],"box.1":["-81.667 -148.767 -81.667 -148.767"],"date":["1998-01-14/1998-07-28"],"link":[],"link.1":[],"link.2":[],"link.3":[],"datasetId":["NSIDC-0098"],"author":{"name":["Jeffrey P.

The rock glaciers are located on peninsulas and capes of the two main islands of the archipelago: King George and Livingston. The South Shetland Islands have a cold oceanic climate, characteristic of the maritime Antarctica, with frequent summer rains and moderate thermal amplitude, and a cold and humid morphoclimatic system, of crionival character. These climatic parameters facilitate the operation of periglacial processes, and the presence of a usually saturated active layer in summer. In the South Shetland Islands the presence of rock glaciers have been identified on Livingston Island (Martinez de Pison et al., 1991; Lopez-Martinez et al., 1992a, 1992b), on Admiralty Bay, in King George Island (Birkenmajer, 1981; Barsch et al., 1985) and in Fildes Peninsula (Barsch et al. 1985; Barsch, 1996; Cheng et al., 1996). Four further active rock glaciers have been identified during the present study in King George and Livingston Island (Serrano and Lopez-Martinez, in prep.). The rock glaciers are located in marginal zones, between 300 m asl and sea level, which has been recently deglaciated, and principally under 70 m asl, near 100 m under the Median Equilibrium Line Altitude (MELA). There are indications of a recent diminution of activity, with blurred fronts, mass movements in fronts and sides, lichen colonization and glaciokarstic processes. All of these indicate an inherited dynamic of past conditions in lower altitudes.\n\nReferences to rock glaciers are scarce in Antarctica, limited to a few examples in the Transantarctic Mountains, Victoria Land, South Georgia, James Ross Island, and South Shetland Islands. The spatial pattern of rock glaciers indicates that they are more represented in the periphery of Antarctica than in the interior of the continent, and are particularly numerous in the Antarctic Peninsula region.

The island is part of the Tertiary volcanic province of West Greenland and is mainly made up by lavas. The landscape is a plateau basalt landscape with cirque carved lava plateaus and U-shaped valleys and fjords. Rock glaciers are frequent in Disko Island (Humlum, 1982). In southern Disko Island, about 60 km SSE of the two study sites, meteorological observations have been carried out since 1923 in the village of Godhavn. The present (1961-1990) mean annual air temperature is -3.9 C, the coldest month is March (-15.1 C), and July is the warmest month (7.1 C). The mean annual precipitation at Godhavn is about 400 mm water equivalent. Most of the precipitation (75 %) usually falls during the period June to December, associated with advection of moist, maritime air masses from the south and southwest along the Davis Strait. The remaining part of the year is comparatively dry, as it is dominated by cold and dry katabatic air masses flowing off the Greenland Ice Sheet to the east. Approximately 60-70 % of the mean annual precipitation is snow and in Godhavn a persistent snow cover is registered from late September to late May.\n\nNo systematic mapping of permafrost or permafrost related terrain features have been carried out in this part of West Greenland. Weidick (1968), however, places Disko Island within the zone of continuous permafrost. This is supported by the occurrence of open system pingos (Christiansen, 1995) and numerous rock glaciers (Humlum, 1982, 1984, 1988a, 1988b, 1996; Humlum et al., 1995; Rasch et al. 1996), which are geomorphic indications of the presence of widespread permafrost in Disko Island. Adopting a standard continental geothermal gradient of about 0.033 C m-1, the mean annual air temperature of -7.5 C (1991-96) indicates a potential permafrost thickness of about 175-225 m. This estimate is presumably somewhat conservative, as the Little Ice Age annual air temperature presumably was about 2C below modern values (Humlum, 1996), which would provide conditions for a somewhat thicker permafrost layer than is suggested by modern meteorological values. The high frequency of rock glaciers on Disko Island is presumably derived from high rock weathering rates (Humlum, 1992).

At the El Salto rock glacier, surveys have been undertaken in order to determine the creep rate. Between 1981 and 1986 temperatures at elevations between 3500 and 3600 m were measured in the active layer to a depth of 1 m with a multipoint temperature recorder (Grant). On the basis of these measurement Buk (1983) determined that the permafrost table was at a depth of about 3 m and the base of the permafrost at 68 m. Similar conclusions were reached by Barsch and King (1989). As an illustration of the importance of avalanches to these forms, the base camp there was destroyed by an avalanche in November 1983. \n\nThe surface of the basin of Morenas Coloradas is 54 square km, of which 10.4 square km is seasonally frozen ground. The remaining 60% of the surface is typically periglacial with rock glaciers as the most important forms. In the glacigenic rock glacier, the clean glacier ice ends in detritus-covered or morainic tongues which result in glacigenic ice being incorporated within the substrate. In this way, ice persists at lower altitudes and under very arid conditions (Lliboutry, 1986; Garleff and Stingl, 1986; Schrott, 1992). Interconnected rock glaciers are generated which undergo different phases of activity not always in agreement with those expected as a resulted of their elevations. That is, they continue to show signs of activity not only at the height of the present 0 degrees C air isotherm, but at lower elevations. In the last step downwards towards the valleys these rock glaciers become inactive, and finally morphologically relict or fossil rock glaciers are found. Meteorological, hydrological and geophysical measurements as well as 5 drillings to a depth of 5 m have been carried out in Morenas Coloradas. At an elevation of 3560 m the temperature oscillates around 0 degrees C (with a maximum variation of 0.5 degrees C) at depths between 4 and 5 m. The annual precipitation (1991-93) is 630 mm and the mean annual temperature is 1.6 degrees C. Using a calculated lapse rate of 0.52 degrees C per 100 m, the 0 degrees C isotherm occurs at approximately 3860 m, which represents a considerable rise in comparison with earlier years. It is assumed that this value is strongly influenced by climate warming in the 1980s and 1990s. Temperatures measured at different depths in Morenas Coloradas at 3560 m are positively correlated with the discharge of Rio Vallecitos (correlation coefficients of 0.8-0.9; significance p=0.01). There is no correlation with snowfall data, however, because of the influence of the 'zonda', a very dry and warm wind (up to 100 km/h) which impedes the accumulation of snow. Between 1978 and 1979, the zonda was active for more than 1000 hours. Discharge from the basin is of good quality and averages 505 l/s with a range from 230 l/s (early spring) to >1000 l/s (summer).

Third, complementary measurements (water temperature and BTS [bottom temperature of snow] measurements) were carried out. These three studies allowed us to determine the activity or inactivity of previously detailed landforms, and to classify them as active, inactive, or relict rock glaciers. The external landforms, frontal slope, vertical organization, flow forms, absence of lichens and the descriptive parameters of rock glaciers allowed us to classify them as relict or active ones.  On the Besiberri, Gemelos, and Argualas rock glaciers we have carried out photogrammetric studies, and on the Argualas rock glacier we carried out a topographic survey from 1991 and also geoelectric soundings (San Jose et al. 1992; Serrano et al. 1995; Fabre et al. 1995).

The Bernese Alps are one of the main European watersheds, separating the catchment area of the Aare (draining into the North Sea via the Rhine) from that of the Rhone (which flows into the Mediterranean Sea). The lowest points of the study area are situated in the valley floors of the two rivers at about 500 m asl, whereas several summits exceed 4000 m asl (highest point-- Finsteraarhorn, 4273 m asl). The main structure of the Bernese Alps is the crystalline Aar massif striking WSW-ENE and culminating in the western part of the study area. To the north and the west, the massif is covered by thrust nappes consisting of sedimentary rocks mainly of Mesozoic and early Tertiary age (chiefly marine limestones, shales, and sandstones). Their summits are considerably lower (mostly between 2000 and 3500 m asl).\n\nAccording to their geographic situation between 46 deg and 47 deg N, the climate of the Bernese Alps is of temperate character typical for the zone of the westerlies. Because of the their horizontal and vertical extension, the Alps themselves have considerable influence on the climate. Based on climatic criteria, two main realms can be distinguished: the moist and quite oceanic part in the north of the main watershed and the slightly more continental part sloping south to the Rhone. The northern part, exposed to the westerlies, shows maximum precipitation during summer, with quite low variability, whereas the south is somewhat dryer, showing no distinct maximum but higher variability. Accordingly, mean cloudiness is higher in the north. This results in an increase in the height of the mean glacier elevation from about 2500 m asl in the northern part of the Bernese Alps to 2900 m asl in the south. Because of the high precipitation (locally exceeding 4000 mm per year) and their external situation, the Bernese Alps show a lower equilibrium line of the glaciers and are the mountain group showing the heaviest glacierization of the Alps, which leaves little space for periglacial phenomena (both the glacier showing the lowermost front and the largest glacier of the Alps are situated within the study site). However, this does not mean that permafrost is rare in the Bernese Alps; above 3300 m asl, permafrost can be considered as continuous. In fact, the bedrock of many of the higher mountains in the Bernese Alps is perennially frozen. The number of rock glaciers found in the Bernese Alps is relatively small compared with other Alpine regions. Furthermore, the objects are quite small. This can be explained with the stronger glacierization. Modelling shows that permafrost ground amounts to roughly half as much as the glacierized area (subglacial permafrost not included).

Benson describing his traverses of Greenland from 1952 to 1955. The notebooks contain data on Greenland snow accumulation, snow temperature, stratigrapy, ice sheet facies, and snow densification. Dr. Benson's notebooks also include a supplementary 1956 snow accumulation study done by the U.S. Air Force. The notebooks have been scanned and put into PDF format. In addition, a compendium of Greenland snow accumulation data, compiled by Dr. Benson in 1986, is included that spans 1911 to 1981. It is in ASCII text format.\n\nDuring a four-year period from 1952 through 1955, Carl Benson, along with many other individuals and several other organizations, dug and studied 146 snow pits and made 288 supplementary snow hardness profiles with a ramsonde instrument along a 1100 mile traverse in Northwest Greenland (Benson 1962). For each exposed pit, temperature, density, ram hardness, and grain size were measured. The data in the notebooks include a listing of all pit locations, a summary matrix of data collected at each station; accumulation data adjusted for Fall 1954 and Fall 1955 reference horizons; average accumulation for all stations; integrated ram hardness (snow density); descriptive stratigraphy, pit profile temperature and density; and pit and core temperature, density, ram hardness, and stratigraphy for each location. Benson's notebooks for 1952 through 1954 were scanned at NSIDC and are available via FTP. As of January 2013, the 1955 notebooks are still in the process of being digitized.

These charts are based on compiled observations of ice conditions reported by a variable network of national organizations, shore-based observers, scientific expeditions, and ships as detailed in each report; in cases where no observations were available, the lead mapmakers extrapolated further ice cover using their knowledge of ice movement. Except for where direct observations are indicated, caution is advised in using the charts’ ice edge because there is no way to quantify the assumptions used in extrapolating ice edge or the error involved in this method. See the note on reliability for further discussion of potential error.

It consists of a Campbell Scientific CR10 micrologger with meteorological sensors for air temperature an relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and solar incoming radiation. It also supports a snow depth sensor, an experimental vegetation temperature and four ground temperatures. It is powered by a 25-AH, 12-volt gel cell (a second gel cell was added in 1989) charged by a 10-watt solar panel. Hourly and Daily sampling was carried out. Data have been quality controlled and fully documented (see documentation files accompanying the data). The High Arctic Integrated Research and Monitoring Area (IRMA) of the GSC was established on Fosheim Peninsula to support interdisciplinary studies related to environmental change. Research carried out between 1989 and 1994, had as primary objective to determine relationships between geomorphic processes and climate in order to help predict the potential geologic impact of global change. Establishment of detailed paleoclimatic records for this region has also been considered essential to provide a context for ongoing climate change. Paleoecological studies (records of peat cores, lakes cores, ice cores, sea cores and archeological records) in concert with other methodologies have been used to outline climatic variability (short, middle or long-term variabilities) and are a primary research component in the region. A major compilation of 20 papers has been produced (see Garneau in press) involving 34 participants from government, universities and industry. The synthesis includes the results from studies of modern conditions (climate, flora and fauna), quaternary geology and glacial history, paleoenvironmental records (i.e. ice cores, ocean, lakes, peat, archeological sites), permafrost dynamics and hydrologic systems. Nine appendices complete the document including a comprehensive bibliography and various data series (climate, vegetation, insects, geophysics, plant and arthropod macrofossils and radiocarbon dates) to provide background forfuture projects in the area.

This is a low relief tip of a bedrock  peninsula covered with several meters of glacial drift and reworked raised beach ridges. The measurements are obtained in the site of well developed patterned ground, sorted polygons, where the influence of plants, including thermal insulation and transpiration, is negligible. The 1985-1986 period was average. Mean annual air temperature was -6.6 C, 0.4 C colder than the long-term (1975-1990) mean, but well within the mean variability. Mean winter air temperature is relatively warm (mean of coldest month, February, is -14.6 C). Annual precipitation was 17 % greater than the ong-term mean (372 mm); however, the number of rain-on-snow events was less (3) than average (5.5). Overall, the reference period is close to long-term averages.  \n \nA program of automated soil temperature recordings was initiated in the summer of 1984, at a patterned ground field site Thermistors were placed approximately 0.1 m apart in an epoxy-filled PVC rod (18 mm outside diameter), buried in the center of a fine-grained domain of a sorted circle, down to 1.14 m below the ground surface. The data presented here covers 7/1/85-7/1/86, once a day (6 am), at two levels (0.0 m, 1.145 m below surface). The resolution of the thermistors is 0.004 C, and the accuracy is estimated to be 0.02 C near 0 C. Missing data accounts for less than 7 %. The gaps are filled with simple average of the beginning and end of the gap values. For a detailed description of the field site and data analysis see Putkonen (1997) and Hallet and Prestrud (1986).

This network represents the only coordinated and standardized program of observations using standard measurement protocols designed to observe and detect decadal changes in the dynamics of seasonal thawing and freezing in high-latitude soils. The Intellectual Merit of this study lies in the need for long-term time series of active layer depth, ground temperature, and thaw settlement measurements at the same locations and across diverse terrain types and regions in order to identify scales of spatial variation, establish trends, and validate models.\n\nThe active layer thickness is measured by physical probing on grids ranging in size from 100 to 1000 meters, by probing at a single point or along transects or from permanently installed frost tubes and soil temperature cables. Sites include several coastal to inland transects in North America, a longitudinal array of sites across Eurasia, and individual sites in several mid-latitude, mountainous regions. The majority of the sites are in arctic tundra regions consisting of fine grained sediments. Bouldery and rocky sites in mountains are being added to the network primarily in Europe as part of the EC Permafrost and Climate in Europe (PACE) project. CALM is being considered as the part of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). \n\nCALM is closely affiliated with the International Permafrost Association (IPA), several IPA working groups, and the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The current protocol for observing the active layer thickness is given in the published ITEX Manual and on the ITEX and IPA Web sites. These activities are part of the IPA Global Geocryological Database (GGD). \n\nA map on the CAPS CD-ROM illustrates the locations of the 130 sites. A comprehensive metadata file for all sites is available.

The SMMR data are interpolated for spatial and temporal gaps, and averaged for display in polar stereographic projection. Maps are based on six-day average brightness temperature data from the middle week of each month. Data are placed into 1/2 degree latitude by 1/2 degree longitude grid cells uniformly subdividing a polar stereographic map according to the geographic coordinates of the center of the radiometers' fields of view.  Overlapping data from separate orbits in the same six-day period are averaged to give a single brightness temperature assumed to be at the cell's center. Oceans and bays are masked so that only microwave data for land areas are displayed.\n\nComparisons of SMMR snow cover maps with previous maps produced by NOAA/NESDIS and US Air Force Global Weather Center indicate that the total snow covered area derived from SMMR is usually about ten percent less than that measured by the earlier products, because passive microwave sensors often can't detect shallow dry snow less than about 5 cm deep. Snow depths are comparable, showing SMMR results to be especially good for uniform snow covered areas such as the Canadian high plains and Russian steppes. Heavily forested and mountainous\nareas tend to mask the microwave snow signatures, and SMMR snow depth\nderivations are less reliable in those areas.\n\nFormerly distributed by NASA/GSFC/NSSDC and NASA Pilot Land Data System (PLDS), these data are now available via ftp from NSIDC."],"box":["-85.0 -180.0 0.0 180.0"],"box.1":["0.0 -180.0 85.0 180.0"],"date":["1978-11-01/1987-08-31"],"link":[],"link.1":[],"link.2":[],"link.3":[],"datasetId":["NSIDC-0024"],"author":{"name":["Alfred T.C.

Most of the mapped locations are east of the Sierran crest. The climate in the region is Mediterranean, with most of the precipitation in the winter months coming as snow at high elevations, but with some monsoonal precipitation in the summer, particularly in the southern end of the range.   There is a very steep gradient in decreasing precipitation eastward from the Sierran crest as a result of rain-shadow orographic effects from the predominately eastward-moving Pacific frontal storms.  PRISM-estimated (Daly et al. 1994) annual precipitation for the RIF locations ranged from 580 to 1880 mm; July precipitation from 5 to 33 mm.  Mean annual maximum temperatures ranged from 1.8 to 15.2 oC, January from -5.7 to 6.2 oC, and July from 11 to 26.3 oC.  Mean annual minima ranged from -8.1 to -0.4 oC, January from -15 to -7 oC, and July from 1.2 to 8.9 oC.  The highest temperatures and lowest precipitation were largely at relict Pleistocene rock glaciers, which tended to be farthest east of the Sierran crest and lower in elevation. We mapped over 430 RIFs, based on field surveys and grouped them into six classes based on morphology and location. These categories constitute a greater range of frozen-ground features than are commonly described in rock-glacier surveys.  Although granitic substrates dominate the Sierra Nevada, they do not in the eastern escarpment, so substrates in the RIF database are about equally divided between granitic and metamorphic.  Ages of rock glaciers ranged from current (active) to relict (late Pleistocene).  We interpreted the presence of outlet springs, basal lakes, suspended silt in outlet streams, and fringing phreatophytic vegetation, in addition to morphologic indications of current rock movement, as evidence for interstitial ice, either persistent or seasonal.\n\n<br>One comma-delimited ASCII file containing information for 430 rock-ice features is available."],"box":["34.5 -119.9 38.8 -118.2"],"link":[],"link.1":[],"link.2":[],"link.3":[],"datasetId":["GGD652"],"author":{"name":["Constance Millar"]},"author.1":{"name":["Robert Westfall"]},"dataCenter":["National Snow and Ice Data Center"],"supportingProgram":["FGDC"],"Parameters":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Cryosphere"],"Term":["Frozen Ground"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Rock Glaciers"]},"Parameters.1":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Land Surface"],"Term":["Frozen Ground"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Rock Glaciers"]},"Distribution":{"Distribution_Format":["ASCII Text"]}}

The seismic observations reveal that the IHT signal consists of extended episodes of stick-slip icequakes (typically thousands per hour) generated when the ice-cliff edges of two tabular icebergs rub together during glancing, strike/slip type iceberg collisions (e.g., between C16 and B15A). With the source mechanism revealed, IHT may provide a promising signal useful for the study of iceberg behavior and iceberg-related processes such as climate-induced ice-shelf disintegration.\n\nHere, a single day of seismometer data for a single station on iceberg C16 is provided as an example of \"a day in the life of an iceberg\" for use by scientists and students wishing to know more about IHT. The station data is from C16 \"B\" site on C16's northeast corner, and the day is 27 December, 2003, a day when B15A struck C16 and caused an episode of tremor that was particularly easy to identify and understand. \n\nThis represents only a small fraction of the total data that exist for the seismic program on iceberg C16. The full data are archived at the IRIS data center (where seismic data is commonly archived). This one-day data set is to provide glaciologists with ready access to a good example of IHT that they can use for teaching and for demonstration purposes. Data are available in comma-delimited ASCII format and Matlab native mat files.

Thermistors were placed at 0, 17, 23 (just above the ice-cemented permafrost) and 40 cm depth. To emplace the sensors, first a soil pit was dug to the level of ice-cemented permafrost. Then a hammer drill was used to make a narrow, 15 cm deep hole into the ice-cemented ground. The thermistor was placed into the drill hole. This procedure caused minimal disturbance to the ice-cemented ground. Air temperature and humidity were measured with a Campbell 207 air probe. The temperature on the surface of an outcrop of Beacon sandstone was measured with a T-type thermocouple. Sunlight was measured with a LiCor 200 pyranometer. The sensors were deployed during Jan 1993 but (due to equipment failure) data storage began only on 6 Jan 1994 and was continued until 16 Jan 1995. All temperature sensors were removed after the data collection interval and calibrated in the laboratory. Calibrations were applied using the Steinhart and Hart (1968) representations for the temperature dependence of the thermistor resistance.

The highest point of this range is the Talgar peak (4973 m a.s.l.). The central part of the range is strongly glaciated; 380 glaciers of total area about 510 sq. km occur here. There are 504 rock glaciers in the Zailiyskiy Alatau Range. On the morphological signs, 429 of this amount of total area 49.77 sq. km are considered to be active. The best studied rock glaciers are concentrated in the central part of the northern slope of the Zailiyskiy Alatau in basins of the Bolshaya (Big) and Malaya (Small) Almatinka rivers. The investigations of rock glaciers of the Northern Tien Shan started in 1923 by geodetic observations of Russian glaciologist N.N.Palgov near the front of the Gorodetsky rock glacier (Zailiyskiy Alatau). The observations were repeated in 1946, 1960, 1977 and 1994 using the theodolite 2T2 of 1'' accuracy. (Gorbunov et al., 1994). The following parameters of each rock glacier were measured.

Since 1975, the investigations of rock glaciers of the Northern Tien Shan are carrying out by the Kazakhstan Alpine Permafrost Laboratory. In order to determine regularities in the distribution of rock glaciers, an inventory using aerial photographs and maps of 1 to 100 000 scale was carried out (Gorbunov, 1979, Titkov, 1988).

Approximately 25 investigations used in situ measurements and satellite and aircraft remote sensing to study this issue. Measurements include surface elevation and ice thickness change rates from aircraft laser altimetry, shallow to intermediate ice cores (for average accumulation rates and their temporal and spatial variability), velocity around the ice-sheet perimeter at an elevation of about 2000 meters, local ice thickening/thinning rates, and climatological observations from automatic weather stations. Satellite data used include elevation change from radar altimetry; mapping of snow facies and zones of summer melt from passive and active microwave; ice velocities from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and from repeat high-resolution visible and SAR imagery; mapping surface and 10-m temperatures, accumulation rates, and surface albedo from microwave and AVHRR data.\n\nData are available either by FTP or through investigator Web sites.

The snow water equivalent describes the amount of liquid water in the snow pack that would be formed if the snow pack was completely melted. The data record is produced using a combination of passive microwave radiometer and ground-based weather station data. The SWE record is produced on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. SWE information is provided for terrestrial non-mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere, excluding glaciers and ice sheets. The data are provided in HDF4 and NetCDF formats along with PNG browser images for quick viewing. A single file contains the data for a single day and contains two fields: the SWE estimate and an error estimate (standard deviation). \n\nThe GlobSnow SWE record, based on methodology by Pulliainen (Pulliainen 2006 and Takala et al. 2011), utilizes a data-assimilation based approach combining space-borne passive radiometer data (SMMR, SSM/I, and SSMIS) with data from ground-based synoptic weather stations. The satellite sensors utilized provide data at K- and Ka-bands (19 GHz and 37 GHz, respectively) at a spatial resolution of approximately 25 km. The SWE product is projected to Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) and provides the daily SWE estimates for whole Northern Hemisphere (lambert's equal-area azimuthal projection) in a single file. Although the EASE-Grid projection can represent data almost to the equator, the product is limited between latitudes 35° and 85° for physical reasons (extent of seasonal snow cover). The input satellite data for the SWE prototype products are from SMMR, SSM/I, and SSMIS sensors acquired from National Snow and Ice Data Center, Boulder Colorado, U.S.A.

During 1993-1997, velocities were measured at a line of stakes about 30 km apart completely around the ice sheet approximately along the 2000 m elevation contour except in the south west, where it was higher because of high mountains, nunataks, and crevasses [Thomas et al., 2000]. More information on these velocities can be found on our web site. Ice thickness was also measured along the traverse by a low-frequency ice-sounding radar [Gogineni et al., 1998]. Snow accumulation was from existing estimates [Ohmura and Reeh, 1991], supplemented by recent German and PARCA measurements and with estimates of total precipitation at weather stations for coastal accumulation rates. \n\nEach estimate refers to the time period over which measurements were made, ranging from years to centuries, but the overall set of results is heavily influenced by results from recent PARCA cores, most of which refer to the past two or three decades. Total snow accumulation within catchment areas corresponding to selected groups of stakes, expressed as a volume flux of ice, was compared to ice discharge between the stake locations. This was calculated as the product of ice thickness and velocity integrated between the stakes, after correcting for the ratio (R) between surface and column-averaged velocity, based on model simulations of the velocity/depth profile [Huybrechts, 1996].\n\n Errors for small catchment areas are quite large because of uncertainties in local accumulation rates, the size of the catchment area, and R [Thomas et al., 1998]. For areas larger than about 100,000 sq km, the random nature of these errors reduces their overall effect to less than seven percent of the snow-accumulation rate, and considerably less for the entire region under study [Thomas et al., 2000]. Snow-accumulation rates range from less than 0.1 m of water equivalent per year in the northeast to more than one meter per year in parts of the southeast, with an average value for the entire ice sheet of about 0.3 m/yr [Bales et al., this issue].\n\nThe data set presented here is in tabular form, with a listing for individual gates of: station locations forming the gates; velocities, ice thicknesses and R estimates at the gates; total upstream accumulation; and resulting estimates of average ice-thickening rates (dH/dt) for the catchment areas appropriate to the gates.\n\nBecause errors in dH/dt are large for single gates, additional Tables are provided giving:\n\n     <ol>\n       <li>Values for larger ice-sheet catchment areas (approximately 30,000 sq km) formed by including several adjacent gates.<\/li>\n<li> Values for 12 larger gates (up to >100,000 sq km) that represent regions of the ice sheet with distinctive patterns of dH/dt. These estimates are compared to independent estimates from altimetry measurements in Thomas et al.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\nErrors in accumulation rates are the largest source of uncertainty in these mass-balance estimates, but they are progressively reduced as more information is acquired. The data presented here were compiled before all PARCA accumulation measurements had been analyzed, so they include different estimates of dH/dt based on accumulation estimates ranging from those in Ohmura and Reeh [1991] to our own attempts to improve these using then available PARCA data, and details of these can be found on our web site. Consequently, the dH/dt estimates provided here will be progressively improved as our estimates of snow accumulation also improve.\n\nOngoing work with these data include:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Investigation of the regions that are significantly out of balance, in an attempt to identify causes for the imbalance.<\/li>\n<li>Progressive updating of the dH/dt estimates using improved accumulation estimates, flow lines based on better maps of ice-sheet topography, and better estimates of R.

This data set contains data on coastal morphology, composition, dominant processes, ground ice, and environmental forcing parameters such as wind speed, storm counts, melt season, and wave energy. A listing of the variables included in the coastal classification can be found in Appendix A of the ACD II Science and Implementation Plan (2006). This information is available for over 800 segments, covering the coastline of all eight regional seas of the Arctic Ocean. The length of individual segments is variable (median length is 38 km), and depends on classification parameters and data availability. The segmentation format is scalable, allowing the adoption of future digital coastlines and the integration of additional data at higher spatial resolution. An assessment of the data quality for the more important quantitative variables has just been completed and the data will be publicly released on an Internet Map Server (IMS). The goal of the IMS will be to allow individual users to prepare their own maps displaying the region and variables of interest.\n\nThe Arctic Coastal Dynamics (ACD) program is a multidisciplinary, multinational program with the goal of understanding circum-Arctic coastal dynamics as a function of environmental forcing, coastal geology and cryology, and morphodynamic behavior. The ACD program was formed under the auspices of the International Permafrost Association (IPA), and is an official project of the International Arctic Sciences Committee (IASC).\n\nThe ACD program is currently focused on developing a circum-Arctic estimate of sediment and organic input from coastal erosion to inner shelf.

(2001). Ongoing projects using these data include: Collaboration with J. Bamber to increase the spatial resolution of our mass-balance estimates in order to identify causes for major imbalance in parts of southern Greenland, and use of the ice velocities to infer basal conditions along the traverse.\n\nDuring 1993-1997 a line of stakes about 30 km apart was established completely around the ice sheet approximately along the 2000 m elevation contour except in the south west, where it was higher because of high mountains, nunataks, and crevasses [Thomas et al., 1998 and 2000]. Each station was precisely surveyed by GPS, with resurvey one or two years later, to yield estimates of ice velocity. Station locations were marked by aluminum poles approximately 2 meters long, inserted close to vertically into the snow surface to a depth of about 1 meter. A second and, in areas of very high accumulation, a third pole was added to the lower pole using connecting sections and hose clamps. At each station, a GPS receiver was set atop the lower pole, by attaching a short length of aluminum rod to the base of the receiver and inserting this into the marker pole. Most stations were installed and surveyed via Twin Otter aircraft, during brief (about 10 minute) stops for station installation, and GPS mounting etc. The GPS receivers were left to operate for a minimum of 40 minutes, and more commonly a few hours. Up to 10 stations were visited during a one-day flight from a nearby coastal station. The GPS data from each day were processed by a point-positioning analysis for the longest-occupied station, with differential solutions for the others relative to this. Errors on resulting horizontal locations were about +/- 2 cm for the longest-occupied station, increasing to about +/- 10 cm for the shortest occupancy, with vertical errors approximately double these values. Additional errors were introduced by tilting of the marker poles during the 1-2 year interim between surveys, increasing the uncertainty by perhaps 5 cm. Consequently, derived velocities are accurate to better than +/- 0.2 m/yr.\n\nThe data were acquired with support from NASA's Polar Research Program, and users requesting the data are asked to provide a brief description of their application of the data. This will help provide NASA with an assessment of the scientific benefits resulting from their support of such efforts."],"date":["1993-01-01/1997-12-31"],"link":[],"link.1":[],"link.2":[],"link.3":[],"datasetId":["NSIDC-0615"],"author":{"name":["Robert Thomas"]},"author.1":{"name":["John  Sonntag"]},"author.2":{"name":["Bea  Csatho"]},"dataCenter":["National Snow and Ice Data Center"],"supportingProgram":["NASA NSIDC DAAC"],"Parameters":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Cryosphere"],"Term":["Snow/Ice"],"Variable_Level_1":[],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Ice Velocity"]},"Parameters.1":{"Category":["EARTH SCIENCE"],"Topic":["Cryosphere"],"Term":["Glaciers/Ice Sheets"],"Variable_Level_1":["Glacier Mass Balance/Ice Sheet Mass Balance"],"Variable_Level_2":[],"Variable_Level_3":[],"Detailed_Variable":["Mass Balance"]},"Keyword":["PARCA"],"Keyword.1":["PARCA-project"],"Distribution":{"Distribution_Format":["Microsoft Excel"]},"Distribution.1":{"Distribution_Format":["ESRI Shapefile"]}}

The GC-Net Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) are equipped with instruments to measure surface energy and mass balance. Currently, the GC-NET archive contains 50 plus station years of measurements. These data have been quality controlled and calibrated.\n\nThe objectives of the GC-Net AWS network are: (1) Assess daily, annual and interannual variability in accumulation rate, surface climatology and surface energy balance at selected locations on the ice sheet where high sensitivity of the ice sheet mass balance to climate anomalies is predicted from modeling results; (2) Assess accurate surface elevation, location, near-surface density at the AWS location with the option to revisit the locations in order to get temporal information for dynamic ice sheet modeling.\n\nThe statistics are based on 12 critical parameters such as: incoming shortwave radiation, reflected shortwave radiation, net radiation, temperature-humidity-wind profile at two levels, wind direction, pressure and surface height. The possible data point count for all AWS and channels is 5.04574 106, whereas 4.72291 106 data were retrieved, resulting in an overall success rate of 93.6 percent.

The La Foppa cirque is characterized by five rock glaciers, of which four are active and one is of uncertain activity or is inactive. These rock glaciers, especially the two largest, named La Foppa I and La Foppa II, have been the subject of geophysical investigations (Lozej and Guglielmin, 1992; Guglielmin et al., 1994; Guglielmin 1997) including BTS measurements (bottom temperature of snow; more than 70 measurements between 1990 and 1993) and STG measurements (shallow temperature of ground in summer) (Calderoni et al. 1993; Guglielmin and Tellini 1992, 1994; Guglielmin 1997). The distribution of BTS and STG measurements indicate that above 2800 asl  the permafrost is continuous whereas below this elevation it is constrained inside the rock glaciers, where it is not continuous.\n\nThree boreholes have been established. One is in the frontal part of La Foppa I where the BTS values are always lower than -3 degrees C, and where the active layer detected with vertical electrical soundings (V.E.S.) ranges from 0.8 to 2.7 meters. The second borehole is in the central part of La Foppa I, where the BTS values range between -0.5 and  -2.1 degrees C, and the V.E.S. indicate an active layer of 3 - 5.5 meters thick.  The third borehole is located on the moraine ridge (of Late Glacial age) at 10 meters of the lateral slope of La Foppa I that overlaps the moraine ridge. Here the BTS values and V.E.S. point out the absence of permafrost. Near the third borehole there is a meteorological station that measures air temperature at 4 meters above the ground, snow cover, snow temperature every 20 cm up to 420 cm, precipitation, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and soil temperature at 2 and 30 cm depth. Borehole data are recorded on data loggers. A sample of the data is presented on the CAPS Version 1.0 CD-ROM.

The atlas contains data on over 1200 digitized Great Lakes ice charts for winters from 1973 to 2002 and three types of analysis products.\n\nThe first analysis product includes ice charts of the following: dates of the first reported ice, dates of the last reported ice, and ice duration for each winter, as well as, the maximum, minimum and average ice cover concentrations.\n\nThe second analysis product is a 30-year set of annual daily ice cover time series. The daily time series was used to create: 1) computer animations of spatial patterns of ice cover for each winter, 2) line plots of lake averaged ice cover for each lake over the 30 winters.\n\nThe third analysis product is weekly statistics. There are weekly ice charts and grids of: maximum, 3rd quartile, median, 1st quartile, and minimum ice cover concentrations for the 30-winter base period. The weekly statistics are based on the original ice chart data set and not on the daily time series.\n\nNSIDC does not distribute this data set.

It was also the first International Polar Year 2007-2008  field project.  \n\nThe SEDNA data portal provides access to many and varied data sets from the diverse set of campaign participants.  The data portal holds 37 entries from remote sensing to in situ measurements collected during the ice camp in March and April 2007. This data collection is distributed by the International Arctic Research Center (IARC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). NSIDC maintains the metadata for this data collection, so the data are easier to find through the NSIDC data catalog and those catalogs with which NSIDC shares metadata. This summary and metadata are accurate as of June 2011.  The UAF archive site may have more recent data updates and publications, please visit their site for the most up-to-date information.\n\nThe mass balance of sea ice and the evolution of sea ice thickness distribution is a key component of the Arctic system. It is controlled by thermodynamic ice growth and melt, mechanical redistribution through ridging and rafting, and transport. The SEDNA experiment was designed in a regional Lagrangian frame of reference and tracked the evolution of a region of ice surrounding the Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station (APLIS) 2007 ice camp in an effort to evaluate the role of mechanical redistribution on ice thickness distribution. The SEDNA data collection is unique in that several ice thickness data sets were inter-calibrated and coordinated with monitoring of the ice pack strain-rate (horizontal deformation) and measurements of internal ice stress. This experiment was designed to improve our understanding of the relationship between sea ice thickness and dynamics and to investigate the stress and strain-rate relationships with a comprehensive suite of spatio-temporal coincident observations.\n\nMeasurements were made with the aim of resolving the time evolving ice thickness distribution in the vicinity of the ice camp, to map ice pack deformation (strain-rate), and track strain-rate and internal ice stress in time. This has required a detailed inter-comparison of ice thickness measurements from a number of sources including submarine upward looking sonar (ULS) (Peter Wadhams), AUV multi-beam ULS (Peter Wadhams and Martin Doble), airborne LIDAR (Rene Forsberg), Helicopter borne electromagnetic induction (EMI) (Christian Haas), and in situ snow and ice measurements with drill and EM-31 soil surveyor (Cathy Geiger and Jackie Richter-Menge). Sea ice deformation was mapped in near-real time from analysis of RADARSat-1 ScanSAR-B by the Map of Moving Topography method (Mani Thomas, Chandra Kambhattmettu, and Cathy Geiger), and high temporal sampling was achieved with an array of GPS drifting buoys (Jenny Hutchings). Matt Pruis used GPS buoys to measure deformation of single leads. Ice stress and mass balance were measured with CRREL stress buoys (Jackie Richter-Menge).
